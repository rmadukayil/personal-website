## Hosting
This website is hosted using Netlify. 

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5a77cb15-b13d-476a-ba84-eb67988ff75f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/modest-mcclintock-46eb9e/deploys)

You can host your site anywhere you want, really. 

But if you want to do as I did, here are some tips to get started:

1. Sign up for Netlify
2. Under the 'Sites' menu option, select 'New Site from Git'
3. Select the appropriate repository. 
4. Ensure your build settings are correct.
   - Build command: 'npm run build'
   - Publish directory: 'public/'
   - Deploy log visibility & builds are up to you
5. Save your settings.
6. Happy deploying!
