'We're gonna have to build Optimus Prime', said my boss. My first thought was - well, that wasn't in the job description. Second thought: 'Why, though?'

## No, really. Why?

A specific subset of VIA employees were undertaking a new project - one that I'm probably not allowed to talk about, so I'll spare you the boring details there. They tapped our team to help design a workshop during this group's project launch - a fun activity for the employees to get to know each other. Bonus points if they could walk away with a fun little message. We didn't think much of it at first. We figured we would put together one of those classic icebreakers that everyone's done before. People would reluctantly do it, learn peoples' names and then go eat their catered food and continue with the remainder of the project launch. 

But my boss had bigger plans. 

This project had an emphasis on a more agile approach to groupwork, which was not something people outside of the IT team were familiar with. Thus, to drive the agile method approach home, he decided that we'd split the members up into teams and step-by-step, have THEM assemble Optimus Prime. 

But before that happened, WE needed to build Optimus Prime.
