'We're gonna have to build Optimus Prime', said my boss. My first thought was - well, that wasn't in the job description. Second thought - ...why?

## No, really. Why?

A specific subset of VIA employees were undertaking a new project - one that I'm probably not allowed to talk about, so I'll spare you the details. They tapped our team to design and lead a workshop during this group's project launch. You know - a fun activity for the employees to get to know each other. Bonus points if they could walk away with a message of sorts. We didn't think much of it at first. We figured we would put together one of those classic icebreakers that everyone's done before. People would begrudgingly participate, go eat their catered food and call it a day.

But my boss had bigger plans. 

This particular project that was launching had an emphasis an agile approach to groupwork, which was not something people outside of VIA's IT team were super familiar with. To really drive home the point about collaboration and iterating upon a product before handing it over, the idea was to get our workshop participants to build something in a series of sprints. That 'something' wouldn't be revealed to them until they started putting all their parts together. And the big reveal at the end would be a product that they all contributed to and would (hopefully) be proud of. Sounds lovely - right?

Yeah. But before we told them how to build Optimus Prime, WE needed to build Optimus Prime. 

## Duct Tape, Cardboard, Spray Paint and Tears

Please note that I'm not a super 'hands-on' person. But for the few days where we put this project together, I became one. We essentially had to design Optimus from cardboard and various other materials, create templates out of these designs and then create one-pagers on how to put each of the parts together to make a whole. 

Naturally, we couldn't do this in the office, so our office for the next few days became my boss' garage. Through trial and error, Optimus was slowly coming together. 




That was the fun part. The boring part was putting together concise one-pagers that a lay-user could read from to put together the final product.
