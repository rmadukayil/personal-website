Heads up - this is more of a rant. 

"Well, when this is all over-"

I can't count the number of times I heard (and said!) that line back in March and early April.

I fully expected to be in Waterloo for my 3B term. Living with friends, heading on those afternoon Timmies runs, hanging out in the engineering building for an ungodly amount of time while we finished assignments, and doing everything else that makes up the true university experience. 

I may have forgotten that a global pandemic doesn't have an expiry date. 

So now, instead of my friends, my roommates are members of my family. Instead of Timmies after lunch, I make myself some coffee. And of course, there are no more late nights spent in a tiny room in Engineering 7 (though maybe my friends and I will end up doing this virtually when school starts ramping up).

As weird as it is going without the social and community aspect of school, there are some positives to consider! For starters, no more 8:30 AM lectures. I could stop there, but I'll keep going. No more half-hearted meal prepping, no more rent payments, no more waiting for the 3 functional laundry machines in a 12-storey building ... and probably so much more. So, for the time being, I'm happy to keep chugging through this semester virtually. 

My next school term will be in Fall 2021, which is when I'll be starting my senior year. I can't say with certainty that things will be better by then, but I am hopeful.
